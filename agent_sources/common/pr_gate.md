## Pre-PR Verification Gate (FullThrottle Loop)

Before submitting any PR, you MUST complete this verification loop. Do NOT skip any step.

1. **RUN** — Execute the project's full test suite, linter, and build.
2. **CHECK** — If any step fails:
   a. Analyze the failure output and fix the root cause.
   b. Return to step 1.
   c. You may retry up to **5 times**. On the fifth failure, STOP and report the issue to the user — do not submit a broken PR.
3. **REBASE** — Once all checks pass, rebase your branch onto `main`:
   - `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`
   - If rebase conflicts arise, resolve them and return to step 1.
4. **FINAL CHECK** — After a successful rebase, run the full suite one more time to confirm the rebase did not introduce regressions.
5. **SUBMIT** — Only after step 4 passes cleanly may you create the PR.

⚠️ A PR submitted without passing this gate is considered a defect.
